# Benchmark Suite

This document describes the benchmark categories under `suite/` — what each one
measures, and the individual benchmarks it contains.

| Category | Focus |
|---|---|
| [Access](#access) | Task invocation cost and pool state, outside of task submission |
| [Core](#core) | Submitting tasks and the work-stealing queue primitives underneath them |
| [Lifecycle](#lifecycle) | Pool construction/destruction and Task's move semantics |
| [Scaling](#scaling) | Cost vs. backlog depth or worker count |
| [Utility](#utility) | Pause/resume, exception handling |

Every benchmark compares PulseThreadPool against oneTBB — `task_arena` +
`task_group`, the industry-standard C++ work-stealing scheduler
PulseThreadPool is modeled after.

Some benchmarks have no meaningful oneTBB equivalent — TBB exposes no public
type-erased callable wrapper comparable to `Task`, no public work-stealing
deque, no pause/resume concept, and no per-arena introspection into queue
depth or active/idle thread counts. Those run through `BENCH_SOLO()` instead
of `BENCH()`, timing PulseThreadPool alone. Sweeps across a varying parameter
(worker count) use `BENCH_CUSTOM()` instead.

## Access

Benchmarks Task invocation cost and already-running pool state — outside of,
and independent from, actual task submission.

### Benchmarks

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `invoke.cpp` | `operator()` on a Task holding a small (SBO-resident) callable, and `operator()` on a Task holding a large (heap-allocated) callable (solo) |
| `state_query.cpp` | `activeTaskCount()` / `queuedTasks()` under load, `idleThreadCount()`, and `isPaused()` / `isStopped()` / `empty()` (solo) |

---

## Core

Benchmarks the fundamental, most frequently exercised operations — submitting
tasks and the work-stealing queue primitives underneath them.

### Benchmarks

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `enqueue.cpp` | `enqueue()` + `future::get()` for a single task, against oneTBB's `task_group::run()` + captured-variable idiom |
| `steal.cpp` | `pushBottom()` + `popBottom()` on the owning thread (uncontended), and `pushBottom()` while a second thread continuously steals (contended) (solo) |
| `detach.cpp` | `detach()` for a single task, and `detach()` for a batch of 64 tasks + drain, against oneTBB's `task_group::run()` |

---

## Lifecycle

Benchmarks object lifetime operations — pool construction/destruction and
Task's move semantics. Task is deliberately non-copyable, so there's no
copy_semantics counterpart here.

### Benchmarks

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `construct_destroy.cpp` | `ThreadPool(n)` construction + destruction, against `tbb::task_arena(n)` with eager `initialize()` |
| `move_semantics.cpp` | Move-constructing a Task holding an SBO-resident callable, and move-constructing a Task holding a heap-allocated callable (solo) |

---

## Scaling

Benchmarks how per-operation cost changes as backlog depth or worker count
grows, independent of any fixed-size repeat count — these sweep a structural
parameter rather than iteration volume.

### Benchmarks

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `queue_depth.cpp` | `pushBottom()` cost at increasing backlog depth (0 / 1,024 / 65,536 entries), exercising `WorkStealingQueue`'s buffer-growth path via `Buffer::grow()` (solo) |
| `worker_count.cpp` | `detach()` / `task_group::run()` batch submit-and-drain throughput at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 workers |

---

## Utility

Benchmarks pool control and error-handling paths that don't belong to any of
the categories above — pausing/resuming, and running tasks that throw.

### Benchmarks

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `pause_resume.cpp` | `pause()` + `resume()` cycle on an idle pool (solo) |
| `exception_path.cpp` | `detach()` on a task that throws uncaught, exercising ThreadPool's own `exceptionCounter_` path (solo); `detach()` on a task that catches its own exception, matched against oneTBB with identical catch-inside-task semantics |

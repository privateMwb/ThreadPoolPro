// A work-stealing thread pool. Each worker owns a Chase-Lev
// WorkStealingQueue (see Detail/WorkStealingQueue.h): local push/pop
// costs no atomic read-modify-write in the uncontended case, and idle
// workers steal from one another before falling back to a set of
// sharded, mutex-guarded injection queues used for submissions from
// non-worker threads — sharded because a single shared queue became the
// dominant contention point as worker count grew (every idle worker
// checks it on every failed steal round).
//
// Run/shutdown state is a single atomic RunState rather than a separate
// stop flag plus a plain-enum shutdown mode: two threads calling
// shutdown() concurrently with different modes would otherwise be a
// data race on that plain enum (only one CAS winner may ever write it;
// see ThreadPool.cpp). Worker wakeup uses a C++20 atomic wait/notify
// token instead of a condition_variable + mutex pair, so submit()'s hot
// path never has to acquire a lock just to (usually redundantly) notify
// a condition variable — see waitUntil() and wakeOne()/wakeAll().

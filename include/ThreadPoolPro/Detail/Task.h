 * @brief Move-only, type-erased callable wrapper with small-buffer
 * optimization.
 * @details Stores callables whose decayed type fits within
 * `SboCapacity` bytes and is nothrow-move-constructible directly inline;
 * everything else is heap-allocated. Type erasure is done through a
 * single shared `VTable*` per callable type (see VTable.h) rather than
 * `std::function`'s per-instance heap-allocated wrapper, so the common
 * case — a small lambda submitted to the pool — costs zero additional
 * allocations beyond whatever the caller's own callable required.

/**
 * @brief Lock-free Chase-Lev work-stealing deque of `Task`.
 * @details The owning worker thread pushes and pops its own end
 * (`pushBottom`/`popBottom`) with no atomic read-modify-write in the
 * uncontended case; other worker threads steal from the opposite end
 * (`steal()`) using a single CAS. Memory ordering follows Lê et al.'s
 * "Correct and Efficient Work-Stealing for Weak Memory Models".
 *
 * The buffer stores `Task*`, not `Task` by value — see Buffer.h for why
 * — which means every push/pop/steal implies a heap allocation or
 * deallocation of the pointed-to `Task`. Because `pushBottom()` and
 * `popBottom()` only ever run on the single owning thread, this class
 * recycles those allocations through a private, non-atomic free list
 * (`freeHead_`) instead of calling `new`/`delete` on every operation —
 * safe precisely because that free list is never touched from any other
 * thread. `steal()` runs on other threads, so it always uses ordinary
 * `delete` and never touches the free list.

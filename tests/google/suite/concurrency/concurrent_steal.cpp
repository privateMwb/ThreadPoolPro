// PulseThreadPool WorkStealingQueue concurrent-steal test suite.
//
// Coverage:
// - Multiple concurrent thieves race with the owner's popBottom().
// - Every pushed task is delivered exactly once.
// - No task is lost.
// - No task is executed more than once.
// - Thieves do not terminate merely because the queue is temporarily empty.

// popBottom() deliver every task exactly once.
//
// Important:
// steal() returning nullopt does NOT mean the entire operation is
// finished. Another thread may currently own the last task, or the
// owner may be racing with a thief. Therefore thieves keep retrying
// until the global completion count reaches taskCount.
